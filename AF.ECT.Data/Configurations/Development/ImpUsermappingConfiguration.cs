/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// ImpUsermapping is a temporary staging table used during data migration processes to establish
/// the mapping between legacy user IDs from old systems and new person IDs and usernames in the
/// RCPHA system. This entity facilitates the translation of user references during migration from
/// legacy authentication systems to the new user management system. This entity has no primary key
/// (keyless entity) as it represents transient mapping data.
/// 
/// Key characteristics:
/// - Keyless entity (HasNoKey) for staging
/// - All nullable properties to accommodate incomplete mappings
/// - Legacy user ID to new person ID mapping
/// - Username association for account linking
/// - Used for user reference translation during migration
/// - Supports reconciliation of user accounts across systems
/// - No foreign key relationships (staging isolation)
/// - Temporary data cleared after successful user migration and validation
/// </remarks>
