/// <summary>
/// Represents a military pay grade/rank in the Electronic Case Tracking system.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This lookup table defines military pay grades and ranks used throughout the system
/// for member identification and organizational hierarchy. Includes enlisted grades
/// (E-1 through E-9), officer grades (O-1 through O-10), warrant officer grades
/// (W-1 through W-5), and civilian grade equivalents.
/// 
/// Pay grades are used to:
/// - Identify service members in case records
/// - Display rank information in user interfaces
/// - Determine approval authorities based on grade/rank
/// - Sort and filter members by seniority
/// - Generate reports organized by grade/rank
/// 
/// The Displayorder field determines the sort order for displaying grades, typically
/// from lowest to highest rank. The Title field contains the formal rank title
/// (e.g., "Private", "Sergeant", "Lieutenant", "Captain"), while Grade contains
/// the pay grade code (e.g., "E-1", "E-5", "O-1", "O-3").
