/// <remarks>
/// Sub-case types provide additional categorization beneath case types, allowing for more specific
/// classification of cases. For example, under a "LOD" case type, sub-case types might include
/// "Active Duty LOD", "Reserve LOD", "Training LOD", etc.
/// 
/// Sub-case types are linked to parent case types via CoreCaseTypeSubCaseTypeMap, creating a
/// many-to-many relationship that enables flexible case categorization and reporting.
