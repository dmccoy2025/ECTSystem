/// Represents a Major Command (MAJCOM) in the Electronic Case Tracking system.

/// <remarks>
/// This lookup table defines Air Force Major Commands (MAJCOMs), which are major functional
/// subdivisions of the Air Force organized by mission or geographic region. MAJCOMs are
/// the primary organizational structure for Air Force units and personnel.
/// 
/// Examples include:
/// - AETC (Air Education and Training Command)
/// - ACC (Air Combat Command)
/// - AMC (Air Mobility Command)
/// - AFMC (Air Force Materiel Command)
/// - AFSOC (Air Force Special Operations Command)
/// - PACAF (Pacific Air Forces)
/// - USAFE (United States Air Forces in Europe)
/// 
/// The Active flag allows MAJCOMs to be disabled (e.g., due to reorganization) without
/// removing historical references to that MAJCOM in existing case data.
/// </remarks>
