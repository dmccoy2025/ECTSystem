/// This lookup table defines the military components (service branches) supported by the system,
/// including Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, and civilian components. Components
/// determine organizational hierarchies, command structures, and component-specific configurations.
/// 
/// Components are used throughout the system to:
/// - Define organizational hierarchies and command chains
/// - Filter data by service branch in queries and reports
/// - Apply component-specific business rules and workflows
/// - Determine approval authorities and routing logic
/// - Generate component-specific reports and metrics
/// 
/// The Abbreviation field provides a short code for display in user interfaces and reports,
/// while CompoDescr contains the full, formal name of the component.
