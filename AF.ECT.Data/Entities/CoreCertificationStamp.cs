/// <summary>
/// Represents a certification statement template used for official approvals in the Electronic Case Tracking system.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Certification stamps provide standardized legal language for official signatures and approvals on case documents.
/// Each stamp contains a Name (short identifier) and Body (the full certification text) that appears on official
/// documents when approvers sign off on case actions.
/// 
/// The IsQualified flag distinguishes between qualified certifications (with limitations or conditions) and
/// unqualified certifications (without reservations). This is important for legal compliance and ensures
/// that approval authorities use appropriate language for their level of endorsement.
/// 
/// Certification stamps are mapped to workflows via CoreWorkflowCertificationStampMap, allowing different
/// workflows to use different certification language based on regulatory requirements.
/// </remarks>
