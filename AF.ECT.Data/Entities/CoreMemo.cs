/// Represents a memorandum attached to a case for official correspondence and documentation.

/// <remarks>
/// CoreMemo stores official memoranda that document case actions, decisions, and communications.
/// Each memo is generated from a template (CoreMemoTemplate) and includes formatted letterhead
/// (CoreMemoLetterhead) for official presentation.
/// 
/// Memos are linked to cases via RefId and can contain multiple content sections stored in
/// CoreMemoContent. The Deleted flag supports soft deletion, allowing memos to be hidden
/// without losing historical records. This is important for audit trails and compliance.
/// 
/// Memos serve as official documentation for case decisions, approvals, notifications, and
/// correspondence with service members, commanders, and medical providers.
