/// <summary>
/// Represents individual permissions granted directly to a specific user.

/// <remarks>
/// CoreUserPermission provides user-level permission overrides that grant or deny specific
/// permissions to individual users, bypassing the group-based permission model. This is
/// useful for exceptions, temporary access grants, or special user requirements.
/// 
/// The Status field ("Active", "Inactive", "Suspended") controls whether the permission
/// is currently effective. This composite key relationship (UserId + PermId) ensures each
/// user-permission combination is unique.
/// 
/// User permissions are evaluated alongside group permissions during authorization checks,
/// with user-level permissions typically taking precedence over group-level permissions.
