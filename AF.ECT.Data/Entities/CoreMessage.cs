/// CoreMessage stores administrative messages, system announcements, maintenance notifications,
/// and user alerts that are displayed across the application. Messages can be configured to:
/// 
/// - Display during specific time windows (StartTime to EndTime)
/// - Show as popup dialogs (Popup = true) for urgent notifications
/// - Target all users or admin users only (IsAdminMessage)
/// - Include formatted content (Message) and optional titles
/// 
/// Messages are displayed prominently in the application UI during their active period and
/// can be used for planned maintenance notifications, policy updates, training announcements,
/// system changes, or emergency alerts. The Name field provides a short identifier for
/// message management and tracking.
