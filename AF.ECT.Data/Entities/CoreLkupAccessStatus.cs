/// <summary>
/// Represents an access status for users and user-role assignments in the Electronic Case Tracking system.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This lookup table defines the statuses that control whether users can access the system
/// and which roles are currently effective. Typical statuses include Active, Inactive,
/// Suspended, Pending, and Expired.
/// 
/// Access statuses are used in two contexts:
/// 1. Core_User.Status_id: Controls whether a user account is active and can log in
/// 2. Core_User_Role.Status_id: Controls whether a specific role assignment is active
/// 
/// This allows fine-grained control over user access:
/// - A user account can be temporarily suspended without deleting the account
/// - Individual role assignments can be disabled without removing them
/// - Access can be set to "Pending" for users awaiting approval
/// - Expired statuses can indicate time-limited access that has lapsed
/// 
/// The system enforces access status checks during authentication and authorization
/// to ensure only active users with active role assignments can perform operations.
/// </remarks>
