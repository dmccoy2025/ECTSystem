/// Represents a chain type in the Electronic Case Tracking system.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This lookup table defines the types of command chains used in the military organizational
/// structure. Chain types determine how cases are routed through the command hierarchy and
/// which approval authorities are invoked for specific actions.
/// 
/// Common chain types include:
/// - Administrative Chain: For routine administrative matters and personnel actions
/// - Operational Chain: For mission-related decisions and operational matters
/// - Medical Chain: For medical evaluations and health-related determinations
/// 
/// Each chain type can have an associated Description that provides detailed guidance on
/// when that chain type should be used. The Active flag allows chain types to be disabled
/// without removing historical references. The system tracks creation and modification
/// metadata for audit purposes.
