/// <summary>
/// Represents a workflow action type in the Electronic Case Tracking system.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This lookup table defines the available actions that can be performed on cases as they
/// move through workflow states. Workflow actions determine what state transitions are
/// possible and what user interactions are allowed.
/// 
/// Common workflow actions include:
/// - Approve: Move the case forward to the next state
/// - Reject: Deny the case and move to a rejection state
/// - Return: Send the case back to a previous state for corrections
/// - Forward: Route the case to a different approval authority
/// - Request Information: Pause processing while awaiting additional data
/// - Withdraw: Cancel the case at the submitter's request
/// 
/// Workflow actions are linked to workflow states via the CoreWorkStatusAction table,
/// which defines which actions are valid for each state. The Type field contains a
/// numeric code while Text contains the user-friendly action label.
/// </remarks>
