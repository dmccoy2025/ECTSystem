# WorkflowClient Refactor Recommendations for ECTSystem

## Overview
The [`AF.ECT.Shared/Services/WorkflowClient.cs`](AF.ECT.Shared/Services/WorkflowClient.cs ) has been successfully moved to the [`AF.ECT.Shared`](AF.ECT.Shared ) project to eliminate duplication. The refactoring included platform-specific differences handling (primarily gRPC channel creation for browser vs. desktop compatibility). The core logic (methods, audit logging, retry policies, etc.) is shared, with Audit.NET now integrated for automated auditing.

### Key Changes Implemented
- **Namespace**: Updated to `AF.ECT.Shared.Services`.
- **Channel Creation**: Refactored to accept pre-configured `GrpcChannel` instead of platform-specific handlers.
- **Audit Logging**: Migrated from custom `LogAuditEvent()` to Audit.NET's `AuditScope.Create()` for automated, structured auditing.
- **GlobalUsings**: Added file-scoped namespaces and cleaned up using directives across projects.
- **Telemetry**: Integrated AddTelemetry extension for enhanced observability.
- **Other**: `IWorkflowClient` and `WorkflowClientOptions` moved to `AF.ECT.Shared`.

The rest of the code (methods, constructors for testing, retry policies, etc.) remains consistent across platforms.

### Key Differences Handled
- **Namespace**: [`AF.ECT.Shared.Services`](AF.ECT.Shared/Services/WorkflowClient.cs ) (unified).
- **Channel Creation**: Abstracted to accept [`GrpcChannel`](AF.ECT.Shared/Services/WorkflowClient.cs ); platform-specific setup handled in client projects.
- **Audit Logging**: Now uses Audit.NET for automated auditing instead of custom logging.
- **Remarks**: Updated documentation for shared context.
- **Other**: Interfaces and options consolidated in [`AF.ECT.Shared`](AF.ECT.Shared ).

### Implementation Status
1. **Move Shared Components**: ✅ Completed
   - [`IWorkflowClient.cs`](AF.ECT.Shared/Services/WorkflowClient.cs ) moved to [`AF.ECT.Shared/Services`](AF.ECT.Shared/Services ).
   - [`WorkflowClientOptions.cs`](AF.ECT.Shared/Services/WorkflowClient.cs ) moved to [`AF.ECT.Shared\Options\`](AF.ECT.Shared/Services/WorkflowClient.cs ).
   - [`WorkflowClient.cs`](AF.ECT.Shared/Services/WorkflowClient.cs ) moved to [`AF.ECT.Shared/Services`](AF.ECT.Shared/Services ).

2. **Refactor [`WorkflowClient.cs`](AF.ECT.Shared/Services/WorkflowClient.cs )**: ✅ Completed
   - Namespace updated to [`AF.ECT.Shared.Services`](AF.ECT.Shared/Services/WorkflowClient.cs ).
   - Main constructor accepts pre-configured [`GrpcChannel`](AF.ECT.Shared/Services/WorkflowClient.cs ).
   - Platform-specific logic removed; handled externally.
   - Audit logging migrated to Audit.NET.

3. **Update Client Projects**: ✅ Completed
   - [`AF.ECT.WebClient`](AF.ECT.WebClient ) configures [`GrpcChannel`](AF.ECT.Shared/Services/WorkflowClient.cs ) with [`GrpcWebHandler`](AF.ECT.Shared/Services/WorkflowClient.cs ) in DI.
   - [`AF.ECT.WindowsClient`](AF.ECT.WindowsClient ) configures with [`HttpClientHandler`](AF.ECT.Shared/Services/WorkflowClient.cs ) in DI.
   - Both reference [`AF.ECT.Shared`](AF.ECT.Shared ) for shared components.

### Next Steps
- The refactor is complete and tested with `dotnet build ElectronicCaseTracking.sln`.
- Audit.NET integration provides automated auditing for compliance.
- If further optimizations are needed, consider platform-specific audit configurations.
