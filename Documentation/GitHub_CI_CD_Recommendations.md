# GitHub Actions CI/CD Recommendations for ECTSystem

## Overview
Based on the ECTSystem's architecture—a .NET Aspire-orchestrated distributed application with ASP.NET Core, Blazor WebAssembly, Win UI (desktop), gRPC services, EF Core, and SQL Server—here are targeted GitHub Actions CI/CD recommendations and suggestions. These focus on automating builds, tests, deployments, and monitoring using GitHub's native CI/CD platform, leveraging .NET Aspire's cloud-native features for seamless integration. I'll assume a typical Azure target like Azure Container Apps (ACA) for web/server components and separate deployment for Win UI, as Aspire supports these. If your deployment target differs, let me know for refinements.

### 1. **Workflow Overview and Structure**
   - **Why?** GitHub Actions provides free CI/CD for public repos with YAML workflows in `.github/workflows/`. For a microservices app, use jobs for build → test → deploy to ensure reliability.
   - **Recommendations**:
     - Create workflows in `.github/workflows/` (e.g., `ci.yml` for CI, `cd.yml` for CD).
     - Use GitHub-hosted runners (e.g., `ubuntu-latest` for .NET builds).
     - Trigger on pushes/PRs to `main` for CI; manual dispatch or releases for CD.
     - Use reusable workflows or composite actions for shared steps.
     - Example high-level structure for `ci.yml`:
       ```yaml
       name: CI
       on:
         push:
           branches: [main]
         pull_request:
           branches: [main]
       jobs:
         build:
           runs-on: ubuntu-latest
           steps:
             # Build steps here
         test:
           runs-on: ubuntu-latest
           needs: build
           steps:
             # Test steps here
       ```

### 2. **Build Job: Restore, Build, and Package**
   - **Why?** Ensures code compiles and packages are ready. Use .NET CLI actions for efficiency.
   - **Recommendations**:
     - Restore NuGet: Use `actions/setup-dotnet` and `dotnet restore`.
     - Build: `dotnet build --configuration Release`.
     - Publish: `dotnet publish` for AppHost, Server, WebClient, Win UI. For Aspire, publish as containers; for Win UI, publish as self-contained app.
     - Upload artifacts: Use `actions/upload-artifact` for reuse in deploy jobs.
     - Example steps:
       ```yaml
       - uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
         with:
           dotnet-version: '9.0'
       - name: Restore dependencies
         run: dotnet restore ElectronicCaseTracking.sln
       - name: Build
         run: dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore
       - name: Publish AppHost
         run: dotnet publish AF.ECT.AppHost/AF.ECT.AppHost.csproj --configuration Release --output ./publish/apphost
       - name: Publish Win UI
         run: dotnet publish AF.ECT.WinUI/AF.ECT.WinUI.csproj --configuration Release --self-contained --runtime win-x64 --output ./publish/winui
       - name: Upload artifacts
         uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
         with:
           name: artifacts
           path: ./publish/
       ```
     - For Blazor, ensure WASM files are published.

### 3. **Test Job: Run Unit and Integration Tests**
   - **Why?** Catches issues early; automate your `AF.ECT.Tests`.
   - **Recommendations**:
     - Run tests: `dotnet test` with coverage.
     - Upload results: Use `actions/upload-artifact` or third-party actions for reports.
     - Add integration tests using Aspire's testing tools.
     - Fail on low coverage or failures.
     - Example steps:
       ```yaml
       - name: Run tests
         run: dotnet test AF.ECT.Tests/AF.ECT.Tests.csproj --configuration Release --collect "XPlat Code Coverage" --results-directory ./test-results
       - name: Upload test results
         uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
         with:
           name: test-results
           path: ./test-results
       ```
     - For EF Core, include migration tests.

### 4. **Security and Quality Gates**
   - **Why?** Ensures compliance in a military app.
   - **Recommendations**:
     - Code analysis: Use `github/super-linter` or `dotnet-format`.
     - Security scans: Integrate `github/codeql-action` for vulnerability checks.
     - Dependency scans: Use `github/dependency-review-action`.
     - Approvals: Require reviews for CD workflows.
     - Example: Add CodeQL after checkout.

### 5. **Deploy Job: Release to Azure or GitHub**
   - **Why?** Aspire simplifies Azure deployments; use azd or GitHub Pages for client.
   - **Recommendations**:
     - For ACA/AKS: Use `azure/login` and `azure/CLI` to run azd deploy for web/server components.
     - For Win UI: Deploy separately (e.g., as MSIX via GitHub Releases or Windows Store).
     - Database: Run EF migrations post-deploy.
     - Secrets: Store in GitHub Secrets (e.g., Azure credentials).
     - Monitoring: Enable Application Insights.
     - Example for ACA:
       ```yaml
       - name: Deploy to Azure
         uses: azure/CLI@v1
         with:
           inlineScript: |
             azd login --service-principal -u ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }} -p ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET }} --tenant-id ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
             azd deploy --environment production
       ```
     - For Blazor client: Deploy to GitHub Pages using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`.
     - Rollbacks: Use deployment protection rules.

### 6. **Monitoring, Alerts, and Best Practices**
   - **Why?** Ensures reliability.
   - **Recommendations**:
     - Alerts: Use GitHub Issues or webhooks for failures.
     - Dashboards: GitHub Insights for metrics.
     - Environments: Use GitHub Environments for staging/prod.
     - Cost: Optimize runners; use self-hosted if needed.
     - Edge cases: Handle schema changes; test deployments.
     - Compliance: Enable audit logs.

### Next Steps
- Start with CI for builds/tests, then add CD. Use GitHub's workflow templates.
- Set up secrets for Azure.
- For help, I can generate sample workflows or update code.

These align with .NET Aspire and GitHub best practices. If you'd like this as a markdown file in the `Documentation` folder, let me know!
